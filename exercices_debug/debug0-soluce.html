<p>What causes errors in HTML?

<ul>

      <li>Unclosed elements: If an element is <strong>not closed properly,
	  then its effect can spread to areas you didn't intend</strong>

	  <li>Badly nested elements: Nesting elements properly is also very important
	    for code behaving correctly. <strong>strong,<em> strong emphasised?</em></strong>
	    <!-- what is this? -->
<!-- test -->

	  <li>Unclosed attributes: Another common source of HTML problems. Let's
	    look at an example: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">link to Mozilla homepage</a>
	
	  <li>And in order to win some time, next time you can use this kind of tools
        <a href="//validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri+with_options">validator w3</a></li>

    </ul>
